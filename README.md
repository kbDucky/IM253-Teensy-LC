These are some of my school projects from an Alternative Controller (alt ctrl) class at Miami University

Not complete as of last commit -- I'm trying to wrangle up old code from google drive and other locations

*Note for file with executable games: \*.exe should launch the game when clicked on in a Windows environment. If not, hard lua code exists in the directory with the same name as the executable*

==========================================================================

Knot Kraze - A group project where students were instructed to use something soft in their own-created game. We used a styrofoam head with touch sensors on it, along with a lot of fluffy yarn, and made a hair combing game. Knots appear and must be combed away by combing on a specific portion of the styrofoam head relating to the location of the knot in the game. Controlled with number keys 1 through 6.

==========================================================================

Pat Pat Revolution - A group project where students were instructed to make a wearable controller for their own-created game, i.e. my first original game. We used a full-body suit with touch sensors on it to make a rhythm game to the tune of 'Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes', which speeds up after every successful runthrough of the game. Game code is *incredibly* messy and doesn't quite work correctly when getting to the further levels of speed, but this was the place I started, and I'm very proud of our playtest demo for class. Controlled with 'h', 's', 'k', 't' keys.

==========================================================================

Color Conflict - A group project where students were instructed to take a non-game and make an alt ctrl game out of it. We used Autodesk Sketchbook on one of our teammember's laptops (for the dimensions and screen locations) and made a colour-matching game where two people took turns choosing colours with a cardboard paint palette containing touch sensors and actual paint colours to signify the part of the colour wheel to be selected with that touch sensor.

==========================================================================

Helping Hand - A project where students were instructed to take a piece of software and create an alt ctrl tool for the software's usage. For usage with Microsoft Word 2016, the screen locations were aligned with my then-laptop's locations of Word's tools. Was a tool that consisted of a wrist wrap and finger buttons to control various Word activites, such as switching (Windows 10) laptop languages and changing font size in a document. Video coming soon.

==========================================================================

Mario Kart 64 - A project where students were instructed to take an existing game and create an alt ctrl controller for it using at least one potentiometer. A racing setup was created for a Mario Kart 64 emulator with a rotary potentiometer as the steering wheel, a slide potentiometer as the gear shift, and touch sensors as gas/brake/clutch pedals for the play of the game.
